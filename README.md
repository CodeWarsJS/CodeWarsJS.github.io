Taking CodeWars JS ideas and making it work in the browser of plain JS

#Plain JavaScript
To start if you did not know that CodeWars.com : the javascript side of it is done in node. I do not know how to use node but many of the problems that need to solved their could be applied to plain javascript. So my plan is to take the problem at codewars.com and apply it to plain javascript. Mabey in the future i would like to learn node Js.
